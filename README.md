# Snake
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python Language, where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food to grow longer without colliding with the walls or its own tail.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: The player can control the snake's movement using [input method], such as arrow keys or WASD.
- Food and Growth: Randomly placed food items appear on the game board, and when the snake eats them, it grows longer.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each food item consumed.
- Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, and the player's final score is displayed.
- Speed Increase: As the snake grows longer or the player's score increases, the game's speed gradually increases, making it more challenging.
